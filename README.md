# GPT-4 Playground
GPT-4 Playground is a simple SvelteKit website that can interact with the GPT-4 API and in simple terms is just ChatGPT using GPT-4. It also has support for basic markdown.

Here's a example of what I got it to do: [I got GPT-4 to make a tf2 story](https://steamcommunity.com/app/440/discussions/0/3820780544823274249)

# Setup
Download or clone the repo, then go into .env and add your OpenAI API Key to the API_KEY parameter.

It's that simple!

# Running
In your console just run `npm run dev` or `npm run dev -- --open` to run the project. From there you can talk to the chatbot and make it do random stuff.

**IMPORTANT: THE LONGER YOU CHAT WITH IT, THE MORE MONEY YOU SPEND (thanks openai for making prompts cost money)!!! IT IS RECOMMENED TO KEEP CONVERSATIONS SHORT!!!!**
